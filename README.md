# ECE6254-final-project

This is the repository for ECE6254 final project. It is also my first humble attempt to realize something in Python. The goal of this project is to implement the convolutional network developed by [VGG group] (http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/very_deep/). We also change the layer structures and compare the performance among all variations. The code skeleton is based on this [Jupyter Notebook] (http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/julienr/ipynb_playground/blob/master/keras/convmnist/keras_cnn_mnist.ipynb). Plus, you can see the [original paper] (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf) for more details.
